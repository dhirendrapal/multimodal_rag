# Multimodal RAG
Multimodal RAG
Multimodal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is an advanced AI system that combines multiple types of data—such as text, images, and potentially other modalities like audio or video—to enhance the capabilities of language models in generating accurate and contextually relevant responses. In a standard RAG system, textual data is typically used, but in a multimodal setup, the system can retrieve and process information from multiple types of data (text, images, etc.) simultaneously.
